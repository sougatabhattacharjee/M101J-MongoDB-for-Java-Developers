Write a program in the language of your choice that will remove the grade of type "homework" 
with the lowest score for each student from the dataset that you imported in the previous homework.
Since each document is one grade, it should remove one document per student.

in mongo shell execute the program written below

var students = db.grades.find( { 'type' : 'homework' }, { 'student_id' : 1, 'score' : 1, '_id' : 0}).sort({ 'student_id' : 1, 'score' : 1 })

// Create a variable to track student_id so we can detect when it changes
var id = "";

// Loop through our query results. Each document in the query is passed into a function as 'student'
students.forEach(function (student) { 
    if (id !== student.student_id) { 
        db.grades.remove(student)
        id = student.student_id; 
    }
});

> db.grades.aggregate({'$group':{'_id':'$student_id', 'average':{$avg:'$score'}}}, {'$sort':{'average':-1}}, {'$limit':1})
{ "_id" : 54, "average" : 96.19488173037341 }
